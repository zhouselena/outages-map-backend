![Lint & Check](https://github.com/dali-lab/crud-template-backend-prisma/actions/workflows/lint_and_check.yml/badge.svg)

This repository is an optional backend starter pack for new DALI projects. Installation and setup instructions are included below. You should eventually customize this README file with project-specific documentation.

## How To Extend This Template

See the template repo's Wiki page.

[Describe notable code style conventions]

We are using [typically a configuration like [CS52's React-Native ESLint Configuration](https://gist.github.com/timofei7/c8df5cc69f44127afb48f5d1dffb6c84) or [CS52's ES6 and Node ESLint Configuration](https://gist.github.com/timofei7/21ac43d41e506429495c7368f0b40cc7)]

### Data Models

For more detailed documentation on our file structure and specific functions in the code, feel free to check the project files themselves.

## Setup

For this setup, we will use MongoDB as the database Prisma operates upon. It should be relatively straightforward to use a different database (like Postgres) with the same code, if you so desire.

1. Clone repo and `yarn install`
2. Create [MongoDB Atlas database](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database)
3. Set up SendGrid API (for email validation)
   - Information about SendGrid API keys: https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/api-keys
4. Set up Amazon AWS s3 bucket (for photo storage)
   - https://brunchlabs.notion.site/ECSA-Uploading-images-to-S3-88be408bf5eb4aa987b7bea211258291
5. Create a `.env` file in the root directory, according to the format specified by `.env.example`
6. Run `yarn prisma db seed` to apply seeding to DB.
7. App should be ready for use now

- `yarn start` to run in production mode
- `yarn run dev` to run with hot reloading

#### Linting

ESLint is set up in this project. To keep code clean, always remember to run `yarn run lint` and fix any lint problems before merging into master.

#### Unit / Integration Testing

TBD

## Deployment

[Where is the app deployed? i.e. Expo, Surge, TestFlight etc.]

[What are the steps to re-deploy the project with any new changes?]

[How does one get access to the deployed project?]
